Using enumerated numbers in an  object

 Enumerated Type 
The enumerated, or enum, data type in Java is used to describe a specific set of values for a variable. 
They are static or final and type-safe. They can not change or be modified. 
Enum types are reference type, meaning they act like a class and can have their own constructors and methods.
